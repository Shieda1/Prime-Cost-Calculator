    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the prime cost<br> 
    What is the prime cost?<br>
    prime cost is the direct cost of production incurred during a specific period of time, it also can be reffered to as the aggregate of all costs that can be directly attributed to the manufacturing process which primarily consists of row material cost and direct labor cost, it is also called direct cost
    How to calculate prime cost?<br>
    To calculate prime cost you should use the following formula:<br>
    prime cost = raw material cost + direct labor cost<br>
    example: a company has $3,400,000 in raw material cost and $2,700,000 in direct labor cost, calculate the prime cost of this company.<br>
    using the prime cost formula the answer will be:<br>
    prime cost = raw material cost + direct labor cost<br>
    prime cost = $3,400,000 + $2,700,000<br>
    prime cost = $6,100,000<br>
    Why use prime cost?<br>
    prime cost is important because it is used to determine a product's minimum sales price. A company will lose money on the units produced if the sales price doesn't exceed the prime cost.<br>
